# Java-telegram-bot
This lib will do the hard work of reading and sending telegram messages. 

After downloading create a new project and add this library with the org.json library (<href>http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/o/Downloadorgjsonjar.htm</href>)

for now it reads/writes telegram messages, with the option of using inlineKeyboard (https://core.telegram.org/bots/2-0-intro#new-inline-keyboards), but in the near future there might be an update :)
